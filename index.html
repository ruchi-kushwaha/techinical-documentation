            <p><b>C++</b> is a middle-level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs. 
                <b>C++</b> runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. 
                This <b>C++</b> tutorial adopts a simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of 
                <b>C++</b> for beginners to advanded software engineers.

                    <p>C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, 
                    free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>C++ is regarded as a <b>middle-level</b> language, 
                        as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup starting in 1979 at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, 
                        New Jersey, as an enhancement to the C language and originally named C with Classes but later it was renamed C++ in 1983.</p>

                <li>
                    <p>C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program.</p>

            <p><b>C++</b> is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great 
                Software Engineer. 
                I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C++:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><p>C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you lot of control in terms of memory management, better performance and finally a robust software development.</p></li>
                    <li><p><b>C++ programming</b> gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming. You will understand low level implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers, or dynamic type identification.</p></li>
                    <li><p>C++ is one of the every green programming languages and loved by  millions of software developers. If you are a great C++ programmer then you will never sit without work and more importantly you will get highly paid for your work.</p></li>
                    <li><p>C++ is the most widely used programming languages in application and system programming. So you can choose your area of interest of software development.</p></li>
                    <li><p>C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker and loader, different data types, storage classes, variable types their scopes etc.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There are 1000s of good reasons to learn C++ Programming. But one thing for sure, to learn any programming language, not only C++, you just need to code, 
                        and code and finally code until you become expert.</p>

            <p>Just to give you a little excitement about <b>C++ programming</b>, 
                I'm going to give you a 
                small conventional C++ Hello World program, 
                You can try it using Demo link</p>
                <p>C++ is a super set of C programming with additional implementation of object-oriented concepts.</p>

            <p>
              You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
              syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
              identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
              can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
            </p>
      
            <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
            <p>
              A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
              while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
              variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
              represent a variable.
            </p>
      
            <p>
              You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
              variable in the same scope. For example:
            </p>
      
            <code
              >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
              CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
              }</code
            >
            However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
            is executed without problems.
            <code
              >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code

            <p>A C++ identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or any other user-defined item. An identifier 
                      starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).</p>
                      <p>C++ does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C++ is a case-sensitive programming language.  
                          Thus, <b>Manpower</b> and <b>manpower</b> are two different identifiers in C++.</p>

          <article>
            <p>A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and C++ compiler totally ignores it.</p>
            <p>Whitespace is the term used in C++ to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters and comments. 
                Whitespace separates one part 
                of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify 
                where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins.</p>
                <h3>Statement 1</h3>
                <code>int age;</code>
                <p>In the above statement there must be at least one 
                    whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them.</p>
                <h3>Statement 2</h3>
                <code>fruit = apples + oranges;   // Get the total fruit</code>
                <p>In the above statement 2, no whitespace characters are necessary between 
                    fruit and =, or between = and apples, although 
                    you are free to include some if you wish for readability purpose.</p>

          <header>Comments in C++</header>
          <article>
            <p>Program comments are explanatory statements that you can include in the C++ code. 
                These comments help anyone reading the source code. All programming languages allow for some form of comments.</p>
                <p>C++ supports single-line and multi-line comments. All characters available inside any comment are ignored by C++ compiler.</p>
                <p>C++ comments start with /* and end with */. For example −</p>
                <code>/* This is a comment */
                    <br>

                    /* C++ comments can also
                    <br>
                       * span multiple lines
                       <br>
                    */</code>
                    <p>A comment can also start with //, extending to the end of the line. For example −</p>
                    <code>#include <iostream>
                        <br>
                        using namespace std;
                        <br>
                        
                        main() {
                            <br>
                           cout << "Hello World"; // prints Hello World
                           <br>
                           
                           return 0;
                           <br>
                        }</code>
                        <p>When the above code is compiled, it will ignore // prints Hello World and final executable will produce the following result −</p>

          <header>C++ Data Types</header>
          <article>
            <p>While writing program in any language, you need to use various variables to store 
                various information. Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. 
                This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.</p>
                <p>You may like to store information of various data types like character, wide character, integer, floating point, double floating point, 
                    boolean etc. Based on the data type of a variable, 
                    the operating system allocates memory and decides
                     what can be stored in the reserved memory.</p>
                     <h2>Primitive Built-in Types</h2>
                     <p>C++ offers the programmer a rich assortment of built-in as well as
